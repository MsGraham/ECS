    <h2>Input</h2>
    
    <p> [explain what input is] </p>
    <p>Some examples of input we talked about in class are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Example #1</li>
        <li>Example #2</li>
        <li>Example #3</li>

    <p>This is what the code for an input looks like in HTML+Javascript:</p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    
    <p>Here are some operators we learned about in class and what they do. For each operator, there is an example of when it will return TRUE and one where it returns FALSE.</p>

    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>Operator</th>
        <th>What it does</th>
        <th>returns TRUE</th>
        <th>returns FALSE</th>

    <tr>
        <td>=</td>
        <td>[what the operator does]</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
        <td>n/a</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>==</td>
        <td>[what the operator does]</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>!=</td>
